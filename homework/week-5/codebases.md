# Codebase Analysis and Selection

For this assignment, I reviewed three interesting GitHub repositories: [YouTubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode), [LittleBigMouse](https://github.com/mgth/LittleBigMouse), and [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher). Below is my analysis of each codebase and why I find one particularly interesting to work on.

## 1. YouTubeExplode
[YouTubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) is a powerful library for downloading videos and playlists from YouTube. I chose this project because I've personally used it for my own film projects, as it's difficult to find a reliable downloader that can fetch original file sizes from YouTube. This project is also built using C#, a language I am familiar with and would like to continue developing my skills with. The codebase is well-maintained, and the owner is live and active.

## 2. LittleBigMouse
[LittleBigMouse](https://github.com/mgth/LittleBigMouse) is a tool that enhances the experience of using multi-monitor setups, allowing for seamless mouse movement across different screens with varying resolutions. I selected this tool mainly because it is developed in C#, and there aren't many open-source projects on GitHub that are actively maintained in this language. The community around this project appears to be engaged.

## 3. Flow Launcher
[Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) is an open-source productivity tool that acts as a powerful search launcher for Windows. It allows users to quickly search for files, applications, and web content, enhancing workflow efficiency. This project caught my interest because it also utilizes C# and offers a wide range of features that are highly customizable.
