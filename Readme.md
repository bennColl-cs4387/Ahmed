#### **List of Solo Fixes**  

- **Improved Pagination Handling in YouTubeExplode**  
  I updated the `GetVideoBatchesAsync` method in the YouTubeExplode library to ensure proper pagination handling, which fixes an issue where not all playlist videos were being retrieved ([#749](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/749)).

2. **Second Solo Fix Attempt**  
   Unfortunately, I was unable to complete my second solo fix for YouTubeExplode ([Issue #782]. This issue was more complex than anticipated, and despite my efforts, I couldn't arrive at a satisfactory resolution within the given timeframe. While it was disappointing, this experience underscored the challenges of working on intricate codebases and highlighted areas where I need to improve.

#### **Group Fix**  
**Unity Kinect V1 SDK Improvement**
Unfortently my group was dissolved as Rifat left so I counitued woriking on fixiing Unity Kinect V1 SDK ([GitHub link](https://github.com/ahmed-esh/Unity-kinect-V1-SDK)). This project involved fixing compatibility issues between Kinect input data and Unityâ€™s engine. The fix required integrating the Kinect SDK to improve hand tracking and event detection.

#### **Learnings**

This course provided me with valuable insights into open-source development. Below are the key takeaways:

1. **Codebase Navigation**  
   One of the most challenging but rewarding aspects was learning to navigate large codebases like YouTubeExplode. It required patience, persistence, and a systematic approach to understanding interconnected modules and their functionality.
   

2. **Failure as a Learning Opportunity**  
   My unsuccessful attempt to fix Issue #782 was a humbling experience. It taught me to manage expectations, understand my limitations, and prepare better for future challenges. Despite the setback, I gained a deeper appreciation for the complexity of open-source projects and the dedication required to make meaningful contributions.

3. **Open-Source Workflow**  
   I became proficient in using GitHub for issue tracking, pull requests, and documentation. These skills will undoubtedly be valuable in future collaborative projects.
